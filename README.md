# Unsplash Photos Browser

An minimal app to fetch photos from unsplashed based on query and save it to json file using all the properties you need like blur_hash, author, source, title, thumbnail etc.

### Disclaimer
Since its makes changes to wallpaper.json file and it was a utility I built to speed up my development process for fetching new wallpapers for meelio.io, JUST MAKE SURE YOU ONLY RUN IT LOCALLY (or make changes accordingly). PS its not productionized at all
